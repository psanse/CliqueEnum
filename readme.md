Clique enumeration (GreedyBB)
===================
This repository contains a release of *GreedyBB* , an algorithm for exhaustive clique enumeration (to appear in *Computers & Operations Research*). 

Source code for *GreedyBB* corresponds with the header file *copt/clique/clique_enum.h*

How it works
--------------------
After building the project, a binary *greedy_bb.exe* si created.
To use the binary simply type:

    greedy_bb.exe -f <FILENAME>

The source code has been tested in Linux and Windows platforms.
